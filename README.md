# AuthRemoteuser: A MediaWiki Extension

The Auth_remoteuser extension allows integration with the web server's built-in
authentication system via the REMOTE_USER environment variable. This variable
is set through HTTP-Auth, LDAP, CAS, PAM, and other authentication systems.
Using the the value of the REMOTE_USER environment variable, this extension
automagically performs a login for this user. The value of this environment
variable also serves as the MediaWiki username. If an account with that name does
not exist yet, one is created.

## Installation
First, add this to your `LocalSettings.php`:

    ####################################################
    # Extension: AuthRemoteuser
    wfLoadExtension( 'AuthRemoteuser' );
    $wgAuthRemoteuserMailDomain = 'example.com';
    
    # If you want the extension to autocreate users not existing you have to add 
    $wgGroupPermissions['*']['autocreateaccount'] = true;
    
    # Settings: AuthRemoteuser
    $wgGroupPermissions['*']['createaccount']   = false;
    $wgGroupPermissions['*']['read']            = false;
    $wgGroupPermissions['*']['edit']            = false;
    ####################################################

Instead of `example.com`, you might want to use the domain of your organization.
It will be appended to the username and should form a valid email address. If
i.e. your username to login (==`REMOTE_USER`) is `jdoe`, the email of the user
will be `jdoe@example.com`.

If your environment uses a different variable then `REMOTE_USER`
you can adjust this like so:

    $wgAuthRemoteuserEnvVariable = 'HTTP_X_REMOTE_USER';
    
## Maintenance scripts

Some maintenance scripts cannot be run from the command line when this extension
is installed. You need to set the value of `REMOTE_USER` in the environment first:

    $ export REMOTE_USER=someadminusername
    $ /usr/bin/php maintenance/refreshLinks.php

## Implementation
The constructor of AuthRemoteuser registers a hook to do the automatic login.
Storing the AuthRemoteuser object in $wgAuth tells MediaWiki that instead of the
MediaWiki AuthPlugin, use us for authentication. This way the plugin can handle
the login attempts.
